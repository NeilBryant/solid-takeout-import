# solid-takeout-import
Import your Google Takeout (etc) data into your solid pod so you can keep it and use it with Solid apps

Google allow you to take the data you have on Goigle Plus and similatr thinsg end export it st the [Google Taekout website](https://takeout.google.com/).  

You select various sorts of data, then ask for it to be delivered in `.zip` file fomat or `.tgz` format.  Google then
does it in the background and send you ane email when it is ready with a download link. (You ccan also ask for it to be stored in various places you control, but not *yet* solid pods,)
- You click on the download link on your computer, and get a zip file (or a .tgz file)

The goal of this project is to take the file you downloaded 

Wha you can do on your computer of course is: 
- Move the zip file onto 
- Double clicked on it to unwrap the files onto your computer's file sytem.
- Expolore the files on your computer.

The goal is to be able to 

- Upload the Zip file onto your solid pod by dragging it onto a folder's green '+' con
- Run this code to to find your own existing solid assests such as contacts and photos
- Use it to copy from your takeout archive file into yoru contacts without replication. 
- Ideally, if you have already imported the data that copy will be eft, and just new stuff added.

This as an MIT-licences open source project.. contributions are very welcome!  
including taking over the whole project.
